# GO-MARKDOWN

This is a simple application to make markdown notes using golang, react-typescript and wails.
This is a new project because I wass bored :)

## Installation

not yet here you can clone the repo and use wails for yourself but there are no packages yet

## Why?

Like I said I was bored and wanted a new project to work on. Something that I wanted to play around with and learn.

*So why golang, wails and react-typescript?*

I am learning golang and wails is a nice and easy to learn gui platform for golang. I am familiar witg react but wanted a step up from js that's why typescript.

## What will it do?

- Able to easely wright markdown documents 
    - with easy keybinds
    - themes
    - custom and default styling
- later on add cloud storage to seamingly sinc between devices? (if demand is high)
